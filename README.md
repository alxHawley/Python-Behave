# PythonBDD Test Repository

Welcome to the PythonBDD project repository! This repository is dedicated to housing tests developed using Behave, a Python-based Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework. The tests within this repository cover a range of scenarios, including API CRUD operations, as well as UI interactions, leveraging Selenium.

## What is BDD and Behave?

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes collaboration between developers, testers, and domain experts to ensure the alignment of software behavior with business requirements. Behave is a Python framework that enables BDD by allowing the creation of human-readable test scenarios and automating their execution.

## Key Components of a Behave Test:

In Behave, tests are written in a natural language format called Gherkin. Each test is composed of the following key components:

- **Feature:** A high-level description of the functionality being tested.
- **Scenario:** A specific test case described in a user-readable manner.
- **Given:** The initial context or setup for the scenario.
- **When:** The action or event that occurs.
- **Then:** The expected outcome or result.

## Setup and Dependencies:

Before you can start running tests, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- Behave
- Requests
- Selenium

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install behave requests selenium
```

## Running Tests:

To run the tests included in this repository, navigate to the project's root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
behave
```

Behave will automatically discover and execute the Gherkin scenarios defined in the project.

## Resources:

- **Gherkin:** Gherkin is a simple language used to write human-readable descriptions of software behavior. It forms the basis for writing Behave test scenarios.
- **Cucumber:** Cucumber is a tool that supports the execution of Gherkin scenarios and promotes collaboration between team members with varying roles.

As the development of this project progresses, this README will be continuously updated to provide more detailed information and additional resources.
