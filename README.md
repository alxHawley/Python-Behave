Python Selenium

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with Python and Selenium tests. It serves as a sandbox for learning and experimentation, helping me enhance my coding and testing skills.

Requirements:

Python: You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

For Python versions 3.4 and later, utilize PIP to manage package installations and dependencies. If you're working with older Python versions, you can install PIP using these instructions: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

Python Modules:

    requests(https://pypi.org/project/requests/): Install with: pip install requests
    jsonschema(https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/): Install with: pip install jsonschema

Selenium: Install Selenium using: pip install selenium
Details can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/selenium/

Selenium WebDriver: These tests are designed for Chrome, so it's necessary to install ChromeDriver. The version of ChromeDriver should match your current Chrome version. Find the ChromeDriver versions and additional information here: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.

For optimal results, consider updating Chrome to the latest version before selecting a compatible ChromeDriver version from: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

After downloading ChromeDriver, place the chromedriver.exe file in the same directory as your browser executable.

Alternatively, you have the option to install other browser drivers such as GeckoDriver for Firefox. Modify the tests accordingly with the information provided here: https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/browsers/
